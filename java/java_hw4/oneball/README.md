Project files : Main.java Ball.java



(Explain project files:)
[Main.java] This file just main function.Create a Jframe object.Then add ball to Jframe,and add a MouseListener .When click the mouse.The thread will start.Then ball can move.
[Ball.java] This file just init one ball.The Ball class implements Runnable.And the run function hava a timer.The run function will every 3s execute it.


(Important note to run your code)
I use macbook os x .The windows size is different between Windos os.So the ball bounce maybe not so accurate. If ta you find it,I can fix it.
